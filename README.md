## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Satisfying the Acceptance Criteria

When opening the daily calender, the current day is displayed on the top of the calendr. 
When scrlling down, the calender presents timeblocks for standard (and extended) buisness hours (8am-8pm). 

Each timeblock is color coded per time of day. Current hour's event box is colored turquoise. Past hours appear gray. 

Input text is able to be saved into each container and viewed after clicking the save button- which saves it to local storage. 

## Future Developments
Style can be updated to be more inviting. Insert a line that hovers over the time of day on the calender. 

Update jumbotron to inlude weather and live time. 

Clear out the contents of the planner each day to start each day with a blank slate.
